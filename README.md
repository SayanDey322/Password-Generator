Password Generator Project
This repository contains two versions of a password generator implemented in Python: a simple version and an advanced version. Both versions allow users to generate secure and customizable passwords.
Project Overview
Simple Password Generator
The simple password generator creates a random password based on user-defined inputs for the number of letters, symbols, and numbers. It uses basic randomization to provide a secure password.

Features:
User-defined password length (letters, symbols, numbers).
Randomly generated password.
Displays the generated password in the console.
Advanced Password Generator
The advanced password generator includes additional options for creating more complex and secure passwords. It offers the ability to specify complexity levels and save passwords to a file.

Features:
User-defined password length (letters, symbols, numbers).
Options for password complexity (low, medium, high).
Ability to save the generated password to a file.
Randomly generated password with higher security options.
